radare2-r2pipe-api
==================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/PabloCastellano/radare2-r2pipe-api.svg?branch=travis)](https://travis-ci.org/PabloCastellano/radare2-r2pipe-api)

This repository contains a high-level API on top of r2pipe, abstracting
the r2 commands with a human-friendly taste.

As long as this API will require some discussion because it will serve
as a way to redesign the R2 C Apis at some point, we must focus on
practical use cases, flexibility, ortogonality and other ities.

Feel free to open issues, send PRs with proposals.
